Mateo, our collaborating artist, created an original piece on a custom built wall, made of bricks that could be removed. Visitors could choose their favorite and take it with them, with the Arona technical specs on the back.</p>

Literal translations of colorful phrases quickly communicated a simple message: I actually know what Spanish speakers are saying. Plus, they sound hilarious. 
                
I sent flyers and tweets to agencies in Spain and drummed up some business. Eaten bread, as they say here in Spain.</p>
